On to things I built while I was there 👇


### Apr 2023 - Nov 2024 (Product Manager)

I was leading the whole product pipeline at this point. I had 4 direct reports (1 designer & 3 APMs)

* zingprime - Loyalty Pass inclusive of below benefits
    * On-Time Guarantee (if your bus is >45 mins late at your destination or pickup point, 50% refund coupon)
    * Additional 5% discount
    * Free Travel Insurance
    * Better Refund & Cancellation Policy
    * Was used heavily for Customer Acquisition. Free zingprime on App Install.
    * We'd much rather prefer a customer directly book & repeat through our app rather than from OTA (coz 14% Take Rate)
* Curated Marketplace (Partner Buses)
    * We had decent traffic on consumer app & huge Travel Agent network but only 300 buses on the road connecting 500 cities
    * We weren't servicing a lot of the routes the users & travel agents were searching for (resulting in zero result pages)
    * Enter Curated Marketplace - Sell non-zingbus branded supply on our platform
    * Got this inventory via GDS intergations with Bitla, Mantis, Abhibus (These are Amadeus/Sabre equivalents for Bus Travel)
* Demand-generation (B2C, B2B)
    * Automated Price Drops (rule based) - On route X to Y, if trip start time is in < 4 hrs & occupancy < 50%, set price to minSupplyPrice
    * Send outbound calls to Travel Agents who work on these routes
    * Send tf rates to Travel Agents who work on these routes
* Multi Modal Product for offbeat destinations
    * Book a **cab+bus+cab** journey via zingbus. All legs of the journey booked through zingbus & managed via zingbus.

### Apr 2022 - Mar 2023 (Associate Product Manager - I)
* Crew App - [zingbus Marshal App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zingbus.zingbusmarshalapp)
    * Automated incentive + salary credit in wallet
        * Driver can see exact breakdown of incentive & salaries (for every task and trip completion)
        * Extract wallet amount directly into Personal bank account (using Razorpay payouts)
    * Nudges -> Next passengers to call, Upcoming pickups/Drops
    * CX Dashboard - Intelligent Alerts
* ***Crew App - Rating Collection for OTA bookings***
    * **Problem** - Most people will only rate your service on OTAs if they have a bad exp.
    * By virtue of this, your service rating will keep falling unless you have promoters on OTA
    * zingbus incentivised crew to get the cx to rate us on OTA after trip completion (by calling. masked calls ofc)
    * Crew could track these tasks, its progress, linked incentive directly from the app
* Implemented WhatsApp chatbot using freshdesk bot builder
    * Resolved 70% of incoming chat volume
