FLOW Framework:
1. **F - Frame**
    - Be very specific about the problem you are solving
    - I like to do some brainstorming with Gemini to refine the problem further
    - Some starter prompts that have given me good results
        - "I will give you an overview of an app that I want to build. I want you to challenge my thinking and help me refine the problem. I am building a XYZ app that does the following things . . ."
        - After you refine your plan and use cases, use the prompt - "Now, I want you to write a structured SOP based on our discussion (not more than 500 words) that I can give to an AI to create a web App"
    - You can also give some reference mocks (generated by Gemini) along with the SOP 
 

2. L - Layout
    - Can share Dribble/Figma design references as images to Agent



3. O - Orchestrate


4. W -
